    <p class="lead">The best ideas can change who we are. Blogapp is where those ideas take shape, take off,
        and
        spark powerful conversations. We’re an open platform where over 100 million readers come to find
        insightful and dynamic thinking. Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of
        any
        topic and bring new ideas to the surface. Our purpose is to spread these ideas and deepen
        understanding
        of the world.

        We’re creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports nuance, complexity, and vital
        storytelling without giving in to the incentives of advertising. It’s an environment that’s open to
        everyone but promotes substance and authenticity. And it’s where deeper connections forged between
        readers and writers can lead to discovery and growth. Together with millions of collaborators, we’re
        building a trusted and vibrant ecosystem fueled by important ideas and the people who think about
        them.
